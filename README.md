# Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird written in Ruby to learn this language from another point of view. 

All the graphics were created by hand - awesome, I know :)

## Game modes
- **Close** - obstacles are apearing closer and closer
- **Fast** - Bird is flying faster and faster
- **Tight** - holes are getting smaller and smaller
